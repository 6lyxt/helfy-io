# helfy.io

**A SaaS platform that generates personalized weekday meal plans with recipes, tailored to individual needs and convenience.**

## Description

helfy.io addresses the common struggle of maintaining a healthy diet during the workweek. By providing personalized meal plans based on user profiles and dietary needs, it simplifies meal planning and promotes healthy eating habits.

Users input their weight, height, age, desired weight, dietary restrictions, cooking skills, time constraints, and budget. The platform then calculates required calories and macronutrients and generates a meal plan for Monday to Friday. Recipes are pulled from a recipe API and filtered based on user preferences and convenience (e.g., "No breakfast," "Quick meals," "Budget-friendly," "No cooking").
